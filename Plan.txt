WE DID IT!!!!!!!


We can have a text box, the user can enter the name of the opponent team, and press enter. When the enter button is pressed, the stats
will be pulled up

Text box can go under the carousel, and then the requested info can be loaded in the same place. Maybe everything could be displayed in 
a table. If time, we could add the logo of the opposing team and UNC's to the side of the table that each represents

Carousel can have instructions and pictures of current/past UNC games/players
