The final project should be a web-based application that reflects the techniques we've learned in class. 
In particular, the architecture of the project should reflect all of the components of a modern AJAX-based application including:

* A dynamic JavaScript-based front end interface (or set of interfaces)

* AJAX-based communication with a RESTful server-side API

* The use of a relational database to store back-end application state.

* The use of an ORM layer to access data in the database.

The use of third-party APIs and/or technologies other than jQuery, PHP, and mySQL as provided in our course webspace is allowed, 
but it would be best if at least some part of the above features were implemented from scratch by your team.

Final projects will be presented orally during the finals period between Dec. 7th and Dec. 11th. Details about scheduling will be forthcoming. 
Each team will get 5 minutes per person for their presentations. Every team member will be expected to have a speaking role.

Teams will also be expected to create written documentation describing the project, it's architecture, database schema, 
and other aspects of the project's design. Guidelines on written documentation will be forthcoming.
