# The Playmakers
COMP 426 Final Project
By: Allie Harrison and Madison Pfaff 

In this project, we are creating an interactive statistcal analysis tool to assess the history and success of the Professional Basketball teams in the NBA. The web interface we created displays images of past and current Tarheel Basketball teams you are able to select to assess specific data. With other options to select data, player statistics are at the touch of a button. Also with using Tableau's API, we will be able to compare data between seasons, between teams, and between players. Our database will contain statistics on the NBA team's performance in a season, player stats, and rankings. The ORM contains a smaller data set (mostly due to the off structure of the data gained for the Tableau data vizualization). 

But it is still a work in progress.
